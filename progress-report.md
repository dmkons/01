# Progress Report - Exercise 1 TDT4255, NTNU Autumn 2013

This document is a short mid-way progress report for exercise 1 of TDT4255.

Our group has not spent a lot of time working on this exercise as of now, which means that we have a lot of work a head of us.
This is because the computer project (TDT4295) has been prioritized.
Luckily, the knowledge acquired when working on the computer project is at least in part transferrable to this exercise.

## What we have done so far

* We have set up some organizational tools, such as git, an IRC channel, and so on.
* We have opened the delivered files and messed about a bit to get an overview of the exercise.
* We have made a program counter.
* We have written a component overview
* We have written this progress report.

## This is a weak progress report

Yes, we know that this is a weak progress report.
Don't worry, we will put in a lot of effort later until the final deadline.
